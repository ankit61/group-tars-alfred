- Implemented a pretrained resnet-101 model to perform object detection on images on the dataset,
    but could not run the model because 1) we did not have GCP credits in time 2) chose not to waste credits
    on data analysis
- Worked on textual analysis portion of data analysis (specifically looking at objects in scene)
- Contributed to writing the report
